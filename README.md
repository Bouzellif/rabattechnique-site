# RabatTechniQue — Static Landing Page

This ZIP contains a single-page bilingual (Arabic / French) landing page for RabatTechniQue.
The contact/booking form is currently non-functional (demo only) — data is stored locally in the browser.

## Included files
- `index.html` — main page (RTL by default, Arabic)
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — language toggle and local demo for bookings
- `assets/logo.svg` — simple logo
- `README.md` — this file

## How to publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public).
2. Upload all files from this ZIP (or push via git).
3. In repository Settings → Pages → deploy from branch `main` (root).
4. The site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

## Notes
- When you buy a domain and hosting, I can help connect the form to a real backend (Firebase, Formspree, or your server).
- The language toggle saves preference in `localStorage`.
